This is the final for N322. When started, the user will be taken to a signup/log in screen. Once the user logs in/creates an account, they can add items to a shopping list. These items can be edited or deleted all together. The usersnames are stored in firebase while the shopping list items are in firestore. To log out, go to the profile tab at the bottom.
